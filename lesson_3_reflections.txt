When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When there is more than one contributor.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because it might conflict with the changes I'm making locally.

- Create a repository in GitHub: click on + and new respository, a link will be provided.)
- Create a remote for local repo: git remote add origin <link>
- Push to the remote: git push <remote to send to> <branch to push>
