When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When there is more than one contributor.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because it might conflict with the changes I'm making locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Clone is a copy of all the directories and commit history from a repository, either local or remote, to a local repository. Branch is the same as clone, but leaving the branch where you clone from also intact in the repository. Fork is clone inside GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- Being in sync with it without having to merge those with our local changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- I would need to contact the person by other means. It would be harder to get to the exact point to collaborate, needing to make copies of files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
- If I am not sure of the changes and I'm just experimenting.

- Create a repository in GitHub: click on + and new respository, a link will be provided.)
- Create a remote for local repo: git remote add origin <https URL>
- Push to the remote: git push <remote to send to> <branch to push>
(Ex: git push origin master)
- Pull from the remote: git pull <remote to get from> <branch to pull>
(Ex: git pull origin master)

Fork: clone a repository from GitHub to GitHub
Branch: happens on a single repository
git remote -v
    $ git remote -v
    origin  https://github.com/mariapython/reflections.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/mariapython/reflections.git (push)

git pull origin master = git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
git log: local commits
git log origin/master: commits on the remote
get diff origin/master master: differences between local and remote
