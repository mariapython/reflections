When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When there is more than one contributor.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because it might conflict with the changes I'm making locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Clone is a copy of all the directories and commit history either from a rrepository, either local or remote. Branch is the same as clone, but leaving athe branch where you clone from also intact in the repository. Fork is clone inside GitHub.



- Create a repository in GitHub: click on + and new respository, a link will be provided.)
- Create a remote for local repo: git remote add origin <link>
- Push to the remote: git push <remote to send to> <branch to push>
(git push origin master)
- Pull from the remote: git pull <remote to get from> <branch to pull>
(git pull origin master)
