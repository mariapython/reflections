What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- A directory .git gets created with all the metadata necessary to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- It is an intermediate step before the repository. It packs things together when you use git add.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- Doing a git diff will show the diff between what is in the working directory and the staging area. If it corresponds to a logical change, I will commit it to the repository. Otherwise, I might discard some change with reset.

git diff: Diff between the working directory and the staging area.
git diff --staged: Diff between the staging area and the most recent commit.
git reset --hard: Removes changes from the working directory and the staging area.
