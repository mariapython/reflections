What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- A directory .git gets created with all the metadata necessary to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- It is an intermediate step before the repository. It packs things together when you use git add.
